Project Proposal: Social Media Sentiment and Stock Market Prediction using Spark
1. Introduction
This project aims to analyze the impact of social media sentiment on stock market movements by utilizing Reddit submissions data. By leveraging Spark for large-scale data processing, we will analyze sentiment trends and develop predictive models that forecast stock price changes based on social media activity.
2. Research Objectives
Sentiment Analysis: Use Spark NLP to analyze Reddit posts and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral.
Stock Correlation: Investigate the correlation between sentiment changes and stock price fluctuations.
Prediction Model: Build machine learning models in Spark to predict stock prices based on sentiment and historical data.
3. Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use Spark to clean and preprocess Reddit data, filtering stock-related discussions.
Sentiment Analysis: Apply Spark NLP for sentiment extraction from Reddit submissions.
Stock Data Integration: Retrieve stock price data and merge with sentiment data using Spark.
Predictive Modeling: Develop machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, LSTM) using Spark MLlib to predict stock movements.
4. Expected Outcomes
Insights into how social media sentiment correlates with stock market trends.
A predictive model built using Spark to forecast stock price changes based on sentiment and historical data.
5. Timeline
EDA & Sentiment Analysis with Spark: Week 1-2
Stock Data Integration & Modeling with Spark: Week 3-6
This project will provide a scalable approach to analyzing social media sentiment and predicting stock market trends using Sparkâ€™s data processing capabilities.
